# learn_openGL

While learning openGL I'm trying to build an isometric plane of cubes.

I think i've got it working.

What I still need to figure out:
# How to click on a cube and select/modify it
# Improve performance & make bigger world. 
  Currently setting world size to 100 (i.e. 99x99) gets 77fps. Not sure if this is good or bad actually.
